		<p>This is an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry_(DHT)">Pastry Network Protocol</a> implemented in Ruby. Nodes can leave and join the network in an ad-hoc manner. The Nodes in the network can broadcast messages with a hashtag, and retrieve all messages of a particular hashtag circulating in the Network.</p> 
		
		<p>Every Node in the Network has a unique ID, which is assigned to it when it joins the network. All messages with a particular hashtag are aggregated by a specific node. </p>
		
		<p>This was a part of my Master's individual project at Trinity. I got my first experience of building an application with a dynamically typed language (Ruby) which was quite fun. For detailed instructions on how to play with it visit the <a href="https://github.com/etSingh/P2PChatServer">source</a>.</p>

    		<img src="../public/images/portfolio/zooop.png" alt="zooop">
		<p>Zooop is a platform that let's food vendors to push real time advertisments from a web portal to an Android application. The idea behind it was to push suggestions to the Android users in chat message format in order to make it more interactive. Through this project I got to work with the MEAN Stack and had my first foray into Android development. </p>
		
		<p>This was a part of the group project for my Master's at Trinity. We were a group of 4 developers. For the development, we followed Agile Methodologies of Software Development, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">XP</a>. It was a great learning experience to be building a web site with the MVC paradigm, deploying on heroku and developing an Android Application.</p>

		<p> Organisr is a web application build using the MEAN stack. It's idea was to target Admins of Facebook Groups for Amature Sports Clubs. It allows users to login via Facebook using the Facebbok Graph API and let's them create a Training session, which is then posted to the Facebook group page.</p>

		<p>It was a fun project, I got to re enforce the skills gained from Zooop and use the FB Graph API. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/etSingh/organisr">source</a>.</p>
